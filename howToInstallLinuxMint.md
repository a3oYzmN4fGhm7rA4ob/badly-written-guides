# Introduction
This guide is made for people who know little about computers to help them install Linux Mint in a way they can understand.

# Common Terms and Questions

## What is a Linux?

## Why Linux Mint?

## What is a Package Manager?
A good article written to explain this can be found here.
Note that Linux Mint uses the `apt` and `flatpak` package managers.

### Linux Mint uses apt and flatpak. What's the difference?



## What is a UEFI BIOS?

In short, it stands for [**U**nified **E**xtensible **F**irmware **I**interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI) [**B**asic **I**nput **O**utput **S**ystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS)

That probably means nothing to you though and isn't very helpful. This is the case for most people, which is completely normal. Annoyingly, some people still call it the **BIOS**, though it should really be just called the **UEFI**. For the sake of clarity, in this guide it is reffered to as the **UEFI BIOS** for ease of description.

The UEFI BIOS is the level of your computer below the Operating System and is generally built into your motherboard by your manufacturer. It takes form of a simple GUI that lets you decide things such as various core hardware functions and which drive to boot from. This will be important in booting a new Operating System.

# Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have a computer running Windows and would like to move to Linux Mint.
It also assumes you can use a search engine to solve problems and don't suffer from general learned helplessness.

Here's a few things you should know.

## Step -2: Ask yourself if you have any files on your Windows machine that you would like to have after the switch. 

This is because Linux uses different file system(s) to Windows, so your OS drive (generally the largest one thats not external) will need to be formatted during the install.

**If you have files you would like to keep.**
> I reccomend backing up any files you would like to keep somewhere else during the install. Purchasing an external storage to save any files you want is a great way to do this.

**If you do not care about any of the files on the machine.**
> You can safely ignore this and move to the next preparation step.

## Step -1: Get a 32GB or larger USB stick.
Do what the step says. You will need this to create a bootable USB of Linux Mint, which you will use to easily install it. Linux Mint is a different operating system, not a Windows installer program.

# Step 0: Creating the Bootable USB
