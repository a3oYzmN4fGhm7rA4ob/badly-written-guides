# Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have a computer running Windows and would like to move to Linux Mint.
It also assumes you can use a search engine to solve problems and don't suffer from general learned helplessness.

Here's a few things you should know.

## Step -2: Ask yourself if you have any files on your Windows machine that you would like to have after the switch. 

This is because linux uses a different file system to Windows, so your OS drive (generally the largest one thats not external) will need to be formatted during the install.

**If you have files you would like to keep.
> I reccomend backing up any files you would like to keep somewhere else during the install. Purchasing an external storage to save any files you want is a great way to do this.

**If you do not care about any files on the machine**
> You can safely ignore this and move to the next preparation step.

## Step -1: Get a 32GB or larger USB stick.
Do what the step says. You will need this to create a bootable USB of Linux Mint, which you will use to easily install it. Linux Mint is a different operating system, not a Windows installer program.
