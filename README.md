# badly-written-guides
A repo for guides I write in markdown format, so I can direct people here instead of having to type 3 paragraphs every time. The guide titles should be pretty self explanatory.

# Getting help
If you have a question or are struggling with something in a guide, feel free to make an issue in this repo with the `HELP!` label, and I (or perhaps another contributor in the future) will help you figure out your issue.

# Stuff for nerds

## Contributing
Any helpful contributions are welcome as long as an LLM/LGM did not take part in any of the creation. If you would like to add your own guides, feel free to do so.
